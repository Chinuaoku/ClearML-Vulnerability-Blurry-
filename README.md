This is about exploiting insecure pickle files. It was disclosed that an attacker could create a pickle file which contains an arbitrary code and upload it as an artifact to a project via the API.

Anytime a user calls the get method within the Artifact class to download and load a file into memory, the pickle file is deserialized on their system, running any arbitrary code it contains.
